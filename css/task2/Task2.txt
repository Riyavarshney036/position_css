1. Absolute Positioning

Definition: An element with position: absolute is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with a position
 value of relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky). If there is no such ancestor, it is positioned relative to the initial containing block
  (usually the <html> element).

Behavior:
The element is removed from the normal document flow, meaning it does not affect the layout of other elements and vice versa.
You can use the 'top', 'righ't, 'bottom', and 'left' properties to specify the element's exact position.

2. Relative Positioning

Definition: An element with position: relative is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow.

Behavior:
The element remains in the normal document flow, and other elements around it are not affected by its new position.
You can use the top, right, bottom, and left properties to specify the element's offset from its original position.

Key Differences

Positioning Context:
Absolute: Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.
Relative: Positioned relative to its original place in the document flow.

Impact on Document Flow:
Absolute: Removed from the normal flow, meaning it does not take up space in the layout.
Relative: Remains in the normal flow, taking up its original space.

Usage:
Absolute: For precise control and specific placements, such as overlays.
Relative: For slight adjustments and as a reference for nested absolute positioning.
