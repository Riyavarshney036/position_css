Explanation:

HTML: The HTML structure contains three div elements with class box and unique classes box1, box2, and box3.

CSS:
body: The body is styled to center the boxes in the viewport.
.box: This base class applies common styles to all the boxes, such as size, color, centering text, and setting
 position: absolute.
.box1, .box2, and .box3: These classes position the boxes at different locations using the top and left properties.
 Each box has a different z-index value:
.box1 (red) has z-index: 1
.box2 (green) has z-index: 3
.box3 (blue) has z-index: 2

How z-index Works:
Stacking Order: The z-index values determine the order in which the boxes are stacked. A higher z-index means the 
element will be on top of elements with a lower z-index.
Box 2 (z-index: 3) is on top.
Box 3 (z-index: 2) is below Box 2 but above Box 1.
Box 1 (z-index: 1) is at the bottom.
